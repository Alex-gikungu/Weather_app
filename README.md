# Weather Web App

This is a web app that allows users to check the current weather for a location by making asynchronous requests (AJAX) to a weather API. The app displays weather data in a user-friendly format and handles error cases gracefully.

## Technologies Used 
- Html
- Javascript
- Css
- Api 

## Features

- Displays the current weather conditions for a specified location
- Allows users to switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit)
- Handles error cases gracefully
- Is responsive and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Installation and how to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.

    git clone 


2. Open the directory in a code editor.

    cd 

3. Update the YOUR_API_KEY placeholder in the script.js file with your weather API key.
4. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
5. Enter a location in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button.
6. The app will display the current weather conditions for the specified location.

## Troubleshooting
If you are getting a 404 error, it means that the weather API is not able to find the city that you are searching for. This could be because the city does not exist, or because you have misspelled the city name.

To fix this problem, you can try the following:

- Make sure that you are spelling the city name correctly.
- Try searching for the city by its ZIP code instead of its name.
- Use a different weather API.
